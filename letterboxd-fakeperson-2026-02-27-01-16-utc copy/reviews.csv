2025-12-22,Lost and Found,1996,https://boxd.it/c9UkvH,4.5,,Filmed in Hong Kong and Scotland in peak 90's fashion. HK vibes haven't changed in 30 years. A film about facing the end of life and hope. Romantic.,hong kong,2025-12-21
2025-12-22,The Wedding Banquet,1993,https://boxd.it/cadqwT,3.5,,"directed by Ang Lee, shot entirely in NYC. Helped me to relive the 90's chinese wedding banquet memories, IMO very accurate vibes down to the wedding games they played. 

I appreciate the relatable story line but this movie just didn't capture my love. The characters felt flat and forced - they didn't have ""rizz"" despite how beautiful Wei Wei is. 

Overall, great piece into the dynamics of homosexuality, family tradition, and the chinese wedding banquets in NYC of the 90s","ang lee, nyc, chinese wedding, 90s",2025-12-21

2026-01-23,Casino,1995,https://boxd.it/cLK1gF,4.5,,"Really awesome Scorsese film based in Las Vegas. Reminds me of Goodfellas but the difference is that in addition to great story telling, i can see the characters really rise and fall. And that's because Casino is based off the life of a real person: Frank ""Lefty"" Rosenthal. Check his wikipedia. I enjoyed the hostility of Joe Pesci as Nicky, Robert De Niros intensity as Sam Rothstein. And Sharon Stones frustration and spiral as her character, Ginger. 
Aesthetics are incredible, set in the shining 70s glitz and glamour of Vegas as an organized crime paradise.",,2026-01-22

Immediately takes audience into a otherworldly cowboy ranches of victorian era Mexico. The film marries food with emotions.

2026-02-20,My Big Fat Greek Wedding,2002,https://boxd.it/dd1Uwl,4,,"Opa! Super cute rom com. Can't believe it took me so many years to get to it. I love that the film highlights the zest and spice of coming from an immigrant family living in America. But despite the cultural differences, family is family. And family comes with rooted traditions and deep obligations -- which can weigh down freedom and personal desires. 

Both sides of the family place themselves into uncomfortable situations. And that's what this is about -- embracing discomfort with bravery and acceptance. 

And I loved how Nia Vardalos, who plays the lead Toula, was cast as an untraditional beauty. Framed as a frumpy, pitiful spinster in the beginning, she pulls herself into better circumstances thru her own ambitions before finding her love. 

Also, gotta try the windex trick :)","family friendly, culture, greek culture, family values",2026-02-19
2026-02-21,Meet Joe Black,1998,https://boxd.it/denwaD,1.5,,"Brad Pitt plays Death as a peanut-butter loving autistic boy and Susan somehow find this mysterious and attractive *cue eye roll* 

They were clearly trying to ride Pitts success in Interview with a Vampire. But the storyline was flat and forced, acting was wooden, and nobody had any chemistry. 

I would only watch this movie for the visuals - nothing else. Great cast, gorgeous set and location, every visual detail was elegant and timeless (the ethereal pool room was straight out of a greek tragedy) 

The whole film felt like a joke that took too long to get to the punchline ""death and taxes""  ",,2026-02-20
